Title : Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks

Published: 2015



The content is based on the code  below:
Live demo:              http://crfasrnn.torr.vision
PyTorch version:    http://github.com/sadeepj/crfasrnn_pytorch
Caffe version:         http://github.com/torrvision/crfasrnn

This repository contains Keras/Tensorflow code for the "CRF-RNN" semantic image segmentation method, published in the ICCV 2015 paper Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks. The online demo of this project won the Best Demo Prize at ICCV 2015. Results of this Keras/Tensorflow code are identical to that of the Caffe and PyTorch based versions above.
